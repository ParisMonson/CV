## Paris Monson
I am driven, a fast learner and eager to develop my skills and experience. I have a passion for learning and pride myself on always knowing more at the end of 
the day than at the start.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

#### This Skill

- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (16th April 2022 to 9th September 2022)

The skills I developed during my time at Makers far exceeded my expectations going into this coding bootcamp. It wasn't learning how to code that I found the most beneficial but rather the array of soft skills and industry best practices that I picked up.

- Used TDD on every project, learnt multiple testing frameworks and the importance of testing in industry software.
- Working with different people on group projects taught me a lot about communication and how to work with different types of personalities effectively.
- Frequently paired with people on challenging tasksâ€¦
- Picked up new programming languages and frameworks for specific projects.


#### Exeter University (September 2017 to August 2020)

- BA Politics and International Relations
- 2:1
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
