## Education

#### Makers Academy (16th April 2022 to 9th September 2022)

The skills I developed during my time at Makers far exceeded my expectations going into this coding bootcamp. It wasn't learning how to code that I found the most beneficial but rather the array of soft skills and industry best practices that I picked up.

- Used TDD on every project, learnt multiple testing frameworks and the importance of testing in the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Working with different people on group projects taught me a lot about communication and how to work with different types of personalities effectively.
- Frequently paired with people on challenging tasks.
- Picked up new programming languages and frameworks for specific projects.

#### Exeter University (September 2017 to August 2020)

- BA Politics and International Relations
- 2:1

## Hobbies

I like to play video games, Chess and go to the gym. Also interested in current affairs.
