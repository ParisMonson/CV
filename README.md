## Paris Monson

Motivated Web Development Bootcamp graduate with fundamental knowledge of software design, development and testing. Seeking to utilize broad educational background with excellent analytical, technical and programming skills to thrive as an entry level software engineer. I am skilled at writing well-designed, testable and efficient code using current best practices in Web development. Having finally found the thing that doesn't feel like work! I am looking for my first software engineering role.

After completing my degree in Politics & IR, I realised that the corporate graduate schemes were not for me. I spent 2 years supporting myself doing a variety of short term jobs, from being a waiter to working in construction. All of them involved working collaboratively, using critical thinking skills honed at University to problem solve and get the job done most efficiently. In my spare time, I kept up my aim to learn to code, an interest I'd developed during Covid Lockdown.

After extensive research and sole searching, I reached the conclusion, that not only was I particularly interested in coding and software engineering but my character and skills suit an industry that values logical thinking and problem solving skills, as well as life long learning, which I value highly as I am always looking to do something new and challenge myself.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (16th April 2022 to 9th September 2022)

The skills I developed during my time at Makers far exceeded my expectations going into this coding bootcamp. It wasn't learning how to code that I found the most beneficial but rather the array of soft skills and industry best practices that I picked up.

- Used TDD on every project, learnt multiple testing frameworks and the importance of testing in the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Working with different people on group projects taught me a lot about communication and how to work with different types of personalities effectively.
- Frequently paired with people on challenging tasks.
- Picked up new programming languages and frameworks for specific projects.

#### Exeter University (September 2017 to August 2020)

- BA Politics and International Relations

## Hobbies

I am constantly finding new things that interest me and my interest's are always evolving. I have recently started playing Chess and am obsessed about it at the moment! I like to meditate and go to the gym before I start my day and am really interested in learning about the world in general so podcasts like the Lex Fridman podcast are a regular listen for me.
