# About Me

I am a motivated web development bootcamp graduate with a sound knowledge of software design, development and testing. Skilled at writing well-designed, testable and efficient code whilst using current best practices in Web Development. I am currently seeking to utilize my broad educational background along with strong analytical, technical and programming skills to thrive as an entry level Software Engineer.

After completing my degree in Politics & International Relations at the University of Exeter during the pandemic, I spent 2 years working in the service sector. My roles involved using critical thinking skills, honed at University, to problem solve and get the job done most efficiently. In my spare time, I furthered my aim to learn to code, an interest I had developed during the pandemic period. As my interest and knowledge of coding and software engineering developed it felt such a natural fit that I looked for a way to retrain. I truly feel my character and skills suit an industry that values logical thinking and problem solving skills. The evolutionary nature of software development and the need to stay up to date and push boundaries make this an exciting industry in which to grow my career. 
 something new and challenge myself.

# Skills

## Hard Skills
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Model View Controller Design (MVC)

## Soft Skills
- ### Critical Thinking 
Critical thinkng is a key asset I have developed particularly through my studies and coursework at university. Learning to observe and interpret issues from a range of angles has led me to improve my analytical thinking. Once solutions become clear, high quality communication is imperative to bring about change. 
- ### Team Player
Working in the service industry for over a year, being a communicative teamplayer was essential. My colleagues and I worked collaboratively to develop strategies to achieve the sales goals at Greggs Bakery. Whilst at Wild Wood, where an open communication was valued, I worked with my team to increase footfall. 
- ### Calm under pressure 
I stay calm when working towards a tight deadline. I am very good at breaking tasks down into smaller manageable parts, prioritizing and then focusing on what needs to be done to achieve the goal. This is one of my biggest strengths and was invaluable during my intensive 16 week coding bootcamp with Makers.

# Education

#### Makers Academy (16th April 2022 to 9th September 2022)

The skills I developed during my time at Makers far exceeded my expectations going into this coding bootcamp. It wasn't learning how to code that I found the most beneficial but rather the array of soft skills and industry best practices that I picked up.

- Used TDD on every project, learnt multiple testing frameworks and the importance of testing in the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Working with different people on group projects taught me a lot about communication and how to work with different types of personalities effectively.
- Frequently paired with people on challenging tasks.
- Picked up new programming languages and frameworks for specific projects.

#### Exeter University (September 2017 to August 2020)

- BA Politics and International Relations
- 2:1

# Hobbies

I am always finding new things that interest me and my interest's are always evolving. I have recently started playing Chess, I like to meditate and go to the gym before I start my day and am really interested in learning about the world in general so podcasts on scientific topics appeal to me.
